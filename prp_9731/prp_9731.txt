HANDOUT 2 ADHERED; NO BUGS TO REPORT

I've done the first project -- Huffman coding.

Using java and the version is "1.8.0_101".

Compilation and execution instruction:

javac henc9731.java

javac hdec9731.java

java henc9731 1.txt        (create 1.txt.huf and delete 1.txt)
     
java hdec9731 1.txt.huf    (create 1.txt and delete 1.txt.huf)

In fact, the code might use a time that a little more than 30 seconds to decoding a 2Mib file(txt,jepg,pdf), perhaps it need 31 or 32 seconds. Because I have a test that 1.6Mib will using 23 seconds.
